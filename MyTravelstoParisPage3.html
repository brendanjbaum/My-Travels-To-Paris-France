  <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month!&nbsp; I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
  <h1>Day 1</h1>
  <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away.&nbsp; Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out this beautiful picture!)&nbsp; We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>On our second day, we went shopping on Avenue des Champs Elysees.&nbsp; Every single person we saw was dressed in the hieght of fashion.</p>
<p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!&nbsp; We went to <em>Notre Dame.</em> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer.&nbsp; After we finished shopping, we visited<em> le Lourve.</em></p>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>The picture below is of me visiting the Arc de Triomphe.&nbsp; It's huge!&nbsp; We also went to le Musee D'Orsay.&nbsp; Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking.&nbsp; I was suprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gaugin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
